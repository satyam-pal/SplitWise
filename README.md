# Splitwise Requirement Specification

## Overview

Splitwise is a web-based expense sharing platform that allows users to create and manage expense groups, add expenses, and easily settle debts among group members. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for developing the Splitwise application.

## Functional Requirements

### User Management

1. **User Registration**: Users should be able to register with their email and password.

### Expense Group Management

2. **Create Expense Group**: Users should be able to create a new expense group and become its administrator.

3. **Add Users to Group**: Group administrators should be able to invite other users to join their expense group.

4. **View Group Members**: Users should be able to see the list of members in each of the expense groups they are part of.

### Expense Management

5. **Add Expense**: Users should be able to add an expense to a specific expense group. They should provide the expense amount, description, and optionally specify the users the expense is shared among.

6. **Shared Expenses**: Users should be able to share an expense with all or a subset of users within an expense group.

### Settlement Management

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Security**: User authentication and data transmission should be secure to protect sensitive information.

2. **Performance**: The application should handle a large number of users, groups, and expenses without significant performance degradation.

3. **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and responsive.

4. **Reliability**: The system should maintain data integrity and be available for use most of the time.

5. **Scalability**: The system architecture should support scalability to accommodate growing user numbers and usage.
